        Huskies are crazy creatures. I would not personally categorize them as
        a breed of dog. They act more like a mix between cats, wolfs, foxes, and humans.
        They are such beautiful creatures, but come preinstalled with serious 
        attitude problems and are very vocal about it.

    <h2 class="center"> FYI before getting a Husky </h2>
    
    <br>

    <p class="center" style="font-size: 14pt;">
        Huskies are not like normal dogs. Normal dogs want to and instictually help their humans.
        On the otherhand, huskies live only to help themselves and satisfy their own needs.
        They dont care about the consequences of their actions and don't care about you unless
        they need you to do something for them.
